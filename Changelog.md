# 2.0.0b16

## Steps

* All:
  * Changed type of `DIE_AREA` and and `CORE_AREA` to
    `Optional[Tuple[Decimal, Decimal, Decimal, Decimal]]`
* `KLayout.XOR`
  * Fixed threads not working properly
  * `KLAYOUT_XOR_THREADS` is now optional, with the thread count being equal to
    your thread count by default
  * Added new variable, `KLAYOUT_XOR_TILE_SIZE`, which is the size of the side
    of a tile in microns (the tile size must be sufficiently smaller than the
    design for KLayout to bother threading)
  * Added `info` prints for thread counts for both `KLayout.XOR` and
    `OpenROAD.DetailedRouting`
* `Magic.*`:
  * `openlane/scripts/magic/common/read.tcl` is now a list of read-related Tcl
    functions used across all Magic scripts
  * Added new variable `MAGIC_CAPTURE_ERRORS` to best-effort capture and throw
    errors generated by Magic.
* `Magic.StreamOut`:
  * Internally set `MAGTYPE` to `mag`
  * Change sequence as follows
    * Old sequence:
      1. Read tech LEF
      1. Read macro LEF views (if applicable)
      1. Read design DEF
      1. Read macro GDS views (if applicable)
      1. Write final GDS
    * New sequence:
      1. Read tech LEF
      1. Read PDK SCL/GDS
      1. Depending on the value of `MAGIC_MACRO_STD_CELL_SOURCE`, if applicable:
         * Read macro GDS views as a black-box
         * Read macro GDS views, de-referencing standard cells (i.e. using PDK
           definitions)
      1. Write final GDS
    * Rationale: The old flow triggers a bug where references for cells inside a
      macro's GDS view were broken broken. A workaround was suggested by Tim
      Edwards and the new flow was adapted from his workaround.
      * Additionally, the new flow is just plain more explicit and
        straightforward.
  * Updated to throw errors when `MAGIC_MACRO_STD_CELL_SOURCE` is set to `macro`
    and:
    * Multiple GDS files are defined per macro
    * A macro's GDS file does not have a PR boundary
  * Fixed issue where black-boxed macros with non-north orientations are rotated
    around the incorrect point
* `Magic.*`
  * Base `MagicStep` no longer overrides `run`, but does override
    `run_subprocess`
* `Odb.*`
  * `openlane/scripts/odbpy/defutil.py`:
    * Added validation for obstruction commands
    * Added exit codes for validation errors in obstruction commands
    * Added a command to remove obstructions
    * Enhanced obstructions regex matching to account for >5 items in an
      obstruction definition.
* Created obstruction-related steps
  * `Odb.AddRoutingObstructions`: Base step for adding obstructions to a design
  * `Odb.RemoveRoutingObstructions`: Base step for removing obstructions from a
    design.
    * The preceding two steps, and their derivatives, should be used in tandem,
      i.e., obstructions should be added then removed later in the flow.
  * `Odb.AddPDNObstructions`: Inherits from `Odb.AddRoutingObstructions`. Runs
    before PDN generation.
  * `Odb.RemovePDNObstructions`: Inherits from `Odb.RemoveRoutingObstructions`.
    Runs after PDN generation.
* `Odb.DiodesOnPorts`, `Odb.HeuristicDiodeInsertion`:
  * Now automatically runs DPL and GRT to legalize after insertion
  * Old behavior kept using new steps: `Odb.PortDiodePlacement` and
    `Odb.FuzzyDiodeInsertion`.
  * Updated underlying script to have some more debugging options/be more
    resilient
  * **API Break**: Updated `HEURISTIC_ANTENNA_THRESHOLD` to be a non-optional
    PDK variable with default variables added in `openlane/config/pdk_compat.py`
  * Fixed a bug where attempting to insert another diode of the same name would
    cause a crash
* `OpenROAD.*`:
  * Added three new entries to set of DesignFormats:
    * `POWERED_NETLIST_SDF_FRIENDLY`
    * `POWERED_NETLIST_NO_PHYSICAL_CELLS`
    * `OPENROAD_LEF`
  * Updated all OpenROAD steps to write the aforementioned new design formats
* `OpenROAD.CTS`, `CVCRV.ERC` (unused):
  * Replaced legacy calls to causing crashes in some situations
* Created `OpenROAD.CutRows`
  * Placed in `Classic` Flow after `OpenROAD.ManualMacroPlacement`
* `OpenROAD.CutRows`, `OpenROAD.TapDecapInsertion`:
  * Renamed `FP_TAP_VERTICAL_HALO` to `FP_MACRO_VERTICAL_HALO`,
    `FP_TAP_HORIZONTAL_HALO` to `FP_MACRO_HORIZONTAL_HALO`
  * Reason for the above renames is that the halo doesn't only affect tap
    insertion, it also affects cut rows generated in the floorplan. This affects
    cell insertion and power rails and anything related to floorplan and std
    cell placement.
* `OpenROAD.Floorplan`:
  * Added new variable `FP_OBSTRUCTIONS` to specify obstructions during
    floorplanning
  * Added a new PDK variable, `EXTRA_SITES`, which specifies alternative sites
    to use for floorplanning (as overlapping rows) even when:
    * Cells without double-heights are not used
    * Double-height cells with missing or mislabeled LEF `SITE`s are used
  * Removed `PLACE_SITE_HEIGHT` and `PLACE_SITE_WIDTH`: can be extracted via
    OpenROAD
* Part of `OpenROAD.GlobalRouting` spun off as `OpenROAD.RepairAntennas`
  * Added `OpenROAD.RepairAntennas` to `Classic` flow after
    `Odb.HeuristicDiodeInsertion`; gated by `RUN_ANTENNA_REPAIR` (with a
    deprecated name of `GRT_REPAIR_ANTENNAS` for backwards compat)
* `OpenROAD.ResizerTiming*`:
  * Added `PL_RESIZER_GATE_CLONING` and `GRT_RESIZER_GATE_CLONING` rspectively,
    which control OpenROAD's ability when calling `repair_timing` (default:
    `true`)
* `OpenROAD.STAPostPNR`
  * Added `timing__unannotated_nets__count` to record number of annotated nets
    reports during PostPnR sta
  * Added `timing__unannotated_nets_filtered__count` which filters the former's
    count based on whether a net has a wire. A wire indicates if a net has
    physical implementation. If a net doesn't have a wire then ii can be waived
    and filtered out.
  * `.lib` and `.sdf` ouputs no longer rely on globbing `self.step_dir`:
    instead, we check against computed paths\\
* Added a new step, `OpenROAD.WriteViews`, which simply updates views with no
  other changes
* `Verilator.Lint`: Fixed bug where inferred latch warnings were not properly
  processed
* `Yosys.*Synthesis`:
  * Per comments from Yosys Team [(1)](YosysHQ/yosys#4039 "comment")
    [(2)](The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane#2051 "comment")
    * Replaced instances of ABC command `rewrite` with `drw -l` with new
      variable `SYNTH_ABC_LEGACY_REWRITE` being set to `true` restoring the
      older functionality (`false` by default)
    * Replaced instances of ABC command `refactor` with `drf -l` with new
      variable `SYNTH_ABC_LEGACY_REFACTOR` being set to `true` restoring the
      older functionality (`false` by default)
  * New variable, `USE_SYNLIG`, enables the use of the Synlig frontend in place
    of the Yosys Verilog frontend for files enumerated in `VERILOG_FILES`
    (disabled **by default**)
  * New variable, `SYNLIG_DEFER`, enables the experimental `-defer` feature (see
    [this part of Synlig's readme](https://github.com/chipsalliance/synlig#example-for-parsing-multiple-files))
    (disabled by default)
  * Underlying scripts reworked to unify how Verilog files, preprocessor
    definitions and top level parameters are handled
  * Exempt SystemVerilog `"$assert"s` from "unmapped cells"
  * Metric `design__latch__count` renamed to `design__inferred_latch__count`
  * Fixed `SYNTH_NO_FLAT` not working.

## Flows

* `Classic` flow
  * `Odb.DiodesOnPorts` and `Odb.HeuristicDiodeInsertion` now run after
    `OpenROAD.RepairDesignPostGRT` (as the latter may create some long wires)
    but still before `Odb.ResizerTimingPostGRT` (as timing repairs take
    priority)
  * `OpenROAD.CheckAntennas` added after `OpenROAD.DetailedRoute`
* Internally updated implementation of `VHDLClassic` flow to dynamically create
  `.Steps` from `Classic`
* Updated documentation of `openlane.config.Variable::Variable.pdk` to make it a
  bit clearer

## Documentation

* `docs/source/index`:
  * Changed markup language from RST to Markdown
  * Better disambiguation between OpenLane 1 and OpenLane 2
  * Removed reference to unused utilities
  * Hid top-level `toctree` polluting the landing page
  * Fixed links to incorrect repository

## Tool Updates

* Additions and changes to Nix to support the `aarch64-linux` and
  `aarch64-darwin` platforms
  * Added overlays for `clp`, `or-tools` and `lemon-graph`
    * Removed custom `or-tools` derivation
    * Removed `lemon-graph` override in `nix/openroad.nix`
  * Changed KLayout build script in an attempt to make it faster (I failed)
  * Added a new argument to `default.nix`, `system`, as `builtins.currentSystem`
    is not available when using nix flakes (where in documentation it is
    described as "non-hermetic and impure": see https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes).
    This change allows passing the system as argument and thus restores
    compatibility with nix flakes.
* Added [Surelog](https://github.com/chipsalliance/surelog) to the included
  utilities
* Extended CI to handle Linux aarch64 builds
* Excluded yosys-ghdl plugin from ARM-based builds and from macOS - never worked
* Updated KLayout to `0.28.11`
* Updated OpenPDKs to `e0f692f`
* Updated OpenROAD to `6f9b2bb`
  * OpenSTA is now built **standalone** just like `openroad-abc` for modularity
    purposes
  * Fixes issue where post-GRT resizing run-time and memory consumption got out
    of hand: see
    https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/issues/4121#issuecomment-1758154668
    for one example
* Updated Verilator to `v5.018`/`67dfa37` to fix a couple crashes, including a
  persistent one with `spm` on Apple Silicon
* Updated Volare to `0.13.0`
* Updated Yosys to `0.34`/`daad9ed`
  * Added the
    [Synlig Yosys SystemVerilog Plugin](https://github.com/chipsalliance/synlig)
* Reworked Nix derivations for the OpenLane shell, OpenLane, and the Docker
  image

## API Breaks

* `openlane/steps/step.py::Step::load`: Argument `state_in_path` renamed
  `state_in`, also takes `State` objects
* Removed `CTS_TOLERANCE`: no longer supported by OpenROAD
* Removed `MAGIC_GDS_ALLOW_ABSTRACT`: Bad practice
* For JSON configurations using `meta.version = 2`, `DIE_AREA` and `CORE_AREA`
  can no longer be provided as strings, and must be provided as an array of four
  numeric elements.
* Removed `GRT_REPAIR_ANTENNAS` from steps, moved to the `Classic` flow

## Misc. Enhancements/Bugfixes

* Added exit code propagation when a `StepError` is caused by
  `CalledProcessError`
* Added default Toolbox when Toolbox is not defined for a step
* Created a `.process_stats.json` file for every subprocess that has general
  statistics about a process's total elapsed time and resource consumption
* Created method `openlane/common/misc.py::Path::startswith`
* Expanded `openlane/common/generic_dict.py::copy_recursive` to support
  dataclasses
* Fixed bug in `openlane/config/config.py::__load_dict` where `pdkpath` was not
  being set in some scenarios
* Fixes and tweaks for step reproducibles:
  * `openlane.steps create-reproducible` has new flag, `--no-include-pdk`, which
    excludes PDK files from reproducibles and make any reference to them utilize
    `pdk_dir::`
  * Slight internal rework for
    `openlane/steps/step.py::Step::create_reproducible` to support flattened
    file structures suitable for testing
  * Reproducibles now no longer include views of the design not explicitly
    declared in step `.inputs`
* Fixed tuple loading for config variables
* Fixed unit test for tuple loading for config variables
* Fixed missing orientations for MACRO variables

## Testing

* Created a new internal subcommand, `openlane.steps create-test`, which creates
  a flat reproducible that can be more easily added as a step unit

* Created step unit testing infrastructure, relying on specially-laid out
  folders that provide input data with the ability to add a per-step input data
  preprocessor and output

  * Requires `--step-rx` flag to be passed to `pytest`
  * Created submodule to host step tests
  * Added step to Nix build that utilizes the step unit testing infrastructure
  * Some space/data duplication avoidance measures: Allow missing `state.json`
    for empty state and creation of `.ref` files

* Ported `aes_user_project_wrapper` from OpenLane 1

* Added `user_proj_timer` from
  https://github.com/efabless/openframe_timer_example/tree/main/openlane/user_proj_timer

* Changed `manual_macro_placement_test` design to have a macro with orientation
  `FN` as a test for the aforemention

* Enable post-GRT resizer for `aes_core`, `spm` and `aes`

* Disabled latch linting for `salsa20`

  * Reimplemented how Yosys plugins work in Nix, so they're all loaded with
    Yosys
    * Added derivations for:

      * [GHDL Yosys Plugin](https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl-yosys-plugin)
  * Created `Yosys.EQY`, a step based on EQY that runs at the very end of the
    flow comparing the RTL inputs and outputs (disabled by default)
  * Modified `Yosys.Synthesis` to support Lighter, which greatly reduces power
    consumption by clock-gating D-flipflops (disabled by default, set
    `USE_LIGHTER` to true to activate)
  * Created new step, `VHDLSynthesis`
    * Created new experimental flow, `VHDLClassic`, incorporating said step and
      removing Verilog-specific steps
* Latches without `always_latch` are now reported as a lint error if the
  variable `LINTER_ERROR_ON_LATCH` is set to `True` (which it is by default)
  * Added latch design to fastest test set for both supported PDKs
* Fixed a race condition with `openlane/steps/step.py::Step::run_subprocess`
* Fixed a bug where `glob` introduced nondeterminism, as glob returns files in
  an arbitrary order on some filesystems:
  https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/glob.html?highlight=sorted
  * All `glob` results were simply sorted.
* Fixed a bug where `openlane/common/toolbox.py::Toolbox::create_blackbox_model`

  the layout
* Added comprehensive documentation on PDKs
* Added documentation for migrating the Macro object
* Added validation for unknown keys for the Macro object
* Added testing for `openlane.common.toolbox::Toolbox::create_blackbox_model`,
  `openlane.common.toolbox::Toolbox::get_lib_voltage`,
  `openlane.flows.sequential::SequentialFlow::__init_subclass__`=
* Updated OpenROAD to `0a6d0fd`: **There is an API break in OpenDB APIs**:
  * `odb.read_def` now takes a `dbTech` and a Path string instead of a
    `dbDatabase` and a Path string.
  * The `dbTech` object can be obtained via the `getTech` method on `dbDatabase`
    objects: `db.getTech()`, for example.

  * SDC_IN set to either `PNR_SDC_FILE` or `SIGNOFF_SDC_FILE` by the appropriate
    steps
* Reimplemented I/O placement in the Classic flow based on the one in ORFS,
  i.e.:
  > "We start the loop in ORFS by ignoring io placement while doing global
  > placement, then do io placement, then re-run global placement considering
  > IOs. Its not perfect but that's the use." - @maliberty
* `open_pdks` -> `dd7771c`

# 2.0.0b13

* Add Linting
  * Added Nix derivation for:
    [Verilator](https://github.com/verilator/verilator)
  * Added the following steps:
    * `Verilator.Lint`
    * `Checker.LintTimingConstructs`
    * `Checker.LintWarnings`
  * Emplaced the three new steps at the beginning of the flow
  * Added `Classic` flow variable:
    * `RUN_LINTER` w/ deprecated name (`RUN_VERILATOR`)

  * Added a `config_vars` property to `Flow`
  * Added a `gating_config_vars` property to `SequentialFlow`, essentially
    replacing `flow_control_variable` (breaking change) with deprecation
    warnings for the latter
  * Added more consistent runtime handling of "abstract class properties"
  * Folded *all* OpenLane 1-style `RUN_` variables into Classic Flow
* Added an undocumented CVC step- upstream no longer supporting CVC in flows
* open_pdks -> `1341f54`
* yosys -> `14d50a1` to match OL1

  behavior from `WIRE_RC_LAYER` to \`DATA_WIRE_RC_LAYER
* Created new PDK variable `CELL_SPICE_MODELS` to handle .spice models of the
  SCLs instead of globbing in-step
* Changed default value of `MAGIC_DRC_USE_GDS`
* Fixed an issue where CI would fail when `vars.CACHIX_CACHE` is not defined
  (affected pull requests)

* Fixed an issue where `openlane/scripts/openroad/pdn.tcl` used a deprecated
  name for a variable
* Fixed a bug where KLayout category names were lacking enclosing single quotes
* Fixed a number of broken links and entries in the documentation

# 2.0.0b12

* Added diode padding to `dpl_cell_pad.tcl`
* Added `FULL_LIBS` to `YosysStep` without any redactions
* Moved all PDN variables to the the `OpenROAD.GeneratePDN` step as
  step-specific PDK variables
* Updated PDN documentation to make sense and added an illustrated diagram of
  values
* Slightly reordered Classic Flow so detailed placement happens right after
  `Odb.HeuristicDiodeInsertion`
* Fixed translation of `FP_PDN_MACRO_HOOKS` when a string is provided (only
  splitting if a `,` is found)
* Removed extraneous `check_placement -verbose` after `common/dpl.tcl` sources
  in OpenROAD scripts

# 2.0.0b11

* Added new `mag` format to design formats, populated by `Magic.StreamOut`
* Added support for `stdin` in reproducibles (mainly for Magic): ejected
  reproducibles now save the input and use it
* Added three new PDK variables to all Magic-based steps: `MAGIC_PDK_SETUP`,
  `CELL_MAGS`, and `CELL_MAGLEFS`, which explicitly list some files Magic
  constructed from `PDK_ROOT`, as well as codifying a convention that variables
  must explicitly list files being used.
* Added new variable to `Magic.SpiceExtraction`, `MAGIC_EXT_ABSTRACT`, which
  allows for cell/submodule-level LVS rather than transistor-level LVS.
* Changed SPEF file saving to only strip asterisks instead of underscores as
  well, matching the folders
* Fixed an issue where OpenLane's type-checking only accepted a single value for
  Literals in violation of
  ["Shortening unions of literals," PEP-586](https://peps.python.org/pep-0586/#shortening-unions-of-literals)
* Fixed an issue where command-line overrides were still treated as strict
  variables
* Fixed an issue where `rule()` would print a line even when log levels would
  not allow it
* Fixed an issue where `PDK_ROOT` was of type `str`
* Updated documentation to provide information on conventions for declaring
  variables
  * Deprecated `StringEnums`, now favoring `Literal['str1', 'str2', …]`

# 2.0.0b10

* Add new commandline options: `--docker-tty/--docker-no-tty`, controlling the
  `-t` flag of Docker and compatible container engines which allocates a virtual
  tty
* Convert CI to use `--dockerized` instead of a plain `docker run`

# 2.0.0b9

* `Flow.start()` now registers two handlers, one for errors and one for
  warnings, and forwards them to `step_dir/{errors,warnings}.log` respectively
* Created `CELL_SPICE_MODELS` as a PDK variable to handle .spice models of the
  SCLs instead of globbing in-step
* Added a "dummy path" for macro translation purposes that always validates and
  is ignored by `self.toolbox.get_macro_views`
* Reduced reliance on absolute paths
  * Special exception carved out for `STEP_DIR`, `SCRIPTS_DIR`
  * Made KLayout scripts more resilient to relative pathing
* Created new "eject" feature, which would make reproducibles for steps relying
  on subprocesses independent of OpenLane

  behavior from `WIRE_RC_LAYER` to `DATA_WIRE_RC_LAYER`
* Fixed issue with `Step.load()` re-validating values, which affected
  reproducibles
* Timing signoff no longer prints if log level is higher than `VERBOSE`
* Use `parse_float=Decimal` consistently when loading JSON strings to avoid fun
  floating point errors
* Removed dependency on State module from `odb` scripts
* Removed custom PYTHONPATH setting from `OdbStep` (which was mostly to mitigate
  problems fixed in #86)

# 2.0.0b8

* Rename incorrectly-named metric rename `clock__max_slew_violation__count` to
  `design__max_slew_violation__count`
* Fix clock skew metric aggregation by using `-inf` instead of `inf`

# 2.0.0b7

* Internally reworked `Config` module
  * `Variable` objects now have a boolean property, `.pdk`, which is set to
    `True` if the variable is expected to be provided by the PDK
  * List of common flow variables now incorporate both option config variables
    *and* PDK config variables, with the aforementioned flag used to tell them
    apart.
  * Individual `Step`s may now freely declare PDK variable, with the implication
    that if a `Flow` or one of its constituent `Step`s has one or more variables
    not declared by the current PDK, the `Step` (and `Flow`) are incompatible
    with the PDK.
  * Mutable data structures are used during the construction of `Config` to
    avoid constant copying of immutable dictionaries
    * Multiple private instance methods converted to private `classmethod`s to
      deal with mutable data structures instead of constantly making `Config`
      copies
  * Getting raw values from the PDK memoized to avoid having to call the Tcl
    interpreter repeatedly
  * All `Step` objects, not just those used with an interactive configuration,
    can now be given overrides upon construction using keyword arguments.
* A number of previously-universal PDK variables are now declared by the `Step`s
  and made non-optional, i.e., the `Step` can expect them to be declared by the
  PDK if the configuration is successfully validated.
* `PDK`, `PDK_ROOT` are no longer considered "PDK" variables as PDK variables
  depend on them
* `PRIMARY_SIGNOFF_TOOL` now a PDK variable and a string so OpenLane is not
  limited to two signoff tools
* `Toolbox.render_png()` now relies on a new `Step` called `KLayout.Render`
* `Config.interactive()` fixed, new Nix-based Colab notebook to be uploaded
  Soon™
* Assorted documentation updates and bugfixes

# 2.0.0b6

* Added `Odb.ApplyDEFTemplate` to `Classic` Flow
* Added `RUN_TAP_DECAP_INSERTION` as a deprecated name for
  `RUN_TAP_ENDCAP_INSERTION`

# 2.0.0b5

* Added `refg::` to documentation
* Fixed issue where "worst clock skew" metrics were aggregated incorrectly
* Fixed issue with referencing files outside the design directory

# 2.0.0b4

* Updated documentation for `run_subprocess`
* Updated Volare to `0.11.2`
* Fixed a bug with `Toolbox` method memoization
* Unknown key errors only emit a warning now if the key is used as a Variable's
  name *anywhere* linked to OpenLane. This allows using the same config file
  with multiple flows without errors.

# 2.0.0b3

* Added ability to create reproducible for any step using instance method
  `Step.create_reproducible()`
* Added ability to load and run Step from Config and State JSON files, working
  for both existing step folders and new reproducibles
* Added new CLI- under either the script `openlane.steps` or
  `python3 -m openlane.steps`, exposing the two functionalities above.
* Added internal ability to load a Config without attempting to load the PDK
  configuration data- i.e., only rely on the user's input

* Added an example IPython notebook to use the aforementioned API.
  * Add a number of APIs to display `State` as a part of a notebook.
* Added various default values for `Step` so it can be used without too many
