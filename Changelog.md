# 2.0.0-dev11

* Added `QUIT_ON_SYNTH_CHECKS`
* Added  `QUIT_ON_UNMAPPED_CELLS`
* Added metric `design__instance_unmapped__count`
* Allowed `MetricChecker` to raise `StepError`

# 2.0.0-dev10
* Updated OpenROAD to `6de104d` and KLayout to `0.28.5`.
* OpenROAD builds now use system boost to cut on build times.
* Added new dedicated interactive mode to replace "Step-by-step" API: activated by calling `ConfigBuilder.interactive`, which replaced `per_step`.
    * State, Config and Toolbox for `Step`s all become implicit and rely on global variables.
    * On the other hand, `config=` must now be passed explicitly to non-interactive flows.
* Added Markdown-based IPython previews for `Step` and `Config` objects.
    * Added an API to render `DEF` or `GDS` files to PNG files to help with that.
* Changed API for KLayout Python scripts to be a bit more consistent.
* Renamed a number of variables for consistency.
* Tweaked documentation slightly for consistency.

# 2.0.0-dev9

* Moved `State` to its own submodule.
* Fixed bug with loading default SCL.

# 2.0.0-dev8

* Added a step-by-step API for OpenLane.
    * Involves new `ConfigBuilder` method, `per_step`, which creates configuration files that can be incremented per-step.
    * This mode is far more imperative and calls may have side effects.
* Added an example IPython notebook to use the aforementioned API.
    * Add a number of APIs to display `State` as a part of a notebook.
* Added various default values for `Step` so it can be used without too many parameters. (`config` is still required, but `state_in` will become an empty state if not provided.)
* Moved various documentation functions to the `Variable` object so they can also be used by IPython.
* Updated documentation for `Variable` object.
* Various documentation updates and fixes.

# 2.0.0-dev7

* More build fixes.

# 2.0.0-dev6

* Added magic builds to macOS
* Fixed KLayout builds on macOS
* Tweaks to Nix build scripts
* Removed hack to make KLayout work on macOS
* Removed NoMagic flow

# 2.0.0-dev5

* Fixed commandline `--flow` override.
* Removed call-stack based inference of `state_in` argument for steps: a step initialized without a `state_in` will have an empty in-state.
* Changed signature of `Flow.run`, `Flow.start` to return `(State, List[Step])`, returning only the last state as the per-step states can be accessed via `step[i].state_out`.
* Removed distinction between the `Step.id` and it factory-registered string: the ID is now used for the factory, in the format `Category.Step` for the built-in steps.
* Fixed `--from` and `--to`, also add validation and case-insensitivity.
* Various bugfixes to Tcl script packager.

# 2.0.0-dev4

* Fix `Optimizing` flow.

# 2.0.0-dev3

* Remove Mako as requirement, migrate relevant code.

# 2.0.0-dev2

* Updated installation instructions.
* Separated variables step-by-step.
* Various fixes to environment variables, especially when using OpenROAD Odb Python scripts.
* Add specialized steps to check and/or quit on specific metrics and/or variables.

# 2.0.0-dev1

* Rewrite OpenLane in Python using a new, Flow-based architecture.
* Add packaging using the Nix Package Manager to replace the Docker architecture.
* Added transparent Dockerization using `--dockerized` commandline argument, with images also built using Nix.
