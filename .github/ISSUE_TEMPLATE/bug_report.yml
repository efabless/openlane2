        This part is incredibly important:

        Please run the following shell command in the OpenLane root folder:

            openlane.env_info || python3 ./openlane/env_info.py

        Then copy and paste the ENTIRE output in the text field below.

        If you need to redact one or more elements of PYTHONPATH for
        confidentiality, please mention that.

      label: Environment report
      render: sh
      description: Please paste the output from the previous command. It will be automatically formatted into code, so no need for backticks.

        You also need to upload some files so we can reproduce your issue.

        If a step fails, you can create a reproducible by going
        into the step directory, then typing `openlane.steps create-reproducible -d .`

        A new directory called `reproducible` should be created. Zip or tarball
        that directory then upload by clicking and dragging the file to
        the text-field below.

        > **Warning:**
        > GitHub's maximum file upload size is 25 MB, so if your upload is larger than 25MB, please consider splitting it as follows:
        > for tar files: `split -b 24M <tar-file-name> "<file-tar-name>.part"`
        > for zip files: `zip -r -s 24M <zip-file-name> <directory-name>`
