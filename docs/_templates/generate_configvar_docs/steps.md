# Built-in Steps and their Configuration Variables
These steps are included with OpenLane and are used by its various built-in
flows.

This page documents these steps, how to get them and their configuration
variables (if applicable).

If you're looking for documentation for the `Step` Python classes themselves,
check the API reference [here](./api/steps/index).

```{admonition} Warnings
:class: warning

* Two steps in a given Flow may share a configuration variable name
  if-and-only-if the variables are otherwise identical, i.e., the name, type,
  and default value all match. Otherwise, the flow will not compile.
* Some steps have a variable prefixed with `RUN_` that enables or disables said
  step. This is a vestige from OpenLane 1 and it is recommended to explicitly
  specify your flow either by using the API or in your JSON configuration file's
  `meta` object.
```

```{admonition} Notes
:class: note

* `?` indicates an optional variable, i.e., a value that may hold a value of
  `None`.  OpenLane steps are expected to understand that these values are
  optional and behave accordingly.

* Variable names denoted (<sup>PDK</sup>) are expected to be declared by the PDK.

  If a PDK does not define one of the required variables, it is considered to be
  incompatible with this step.
