${"#"} Universal Flow Configuration Variables

These are flow configuration variables that are used commonly enough that we
decided to expose them to all steps and all flows.

Configuration objects, be they JSON, Tcl or directly passed to the Python API,
can freely override these values.

```{note}
`?` indicates an optional variable, i.e., a value that may hold a value of
`None`.  OpenLane steps are expected to understand that these values are
optional and behave accordingly.
```

| Variable Name | Type | Description | Default | Units |
| - | - | - | - | - |
%for var in option_variables:
| [`${var.name}`]{#${var._get_docs_identifier()}} | ${var.type_repr_md(for_document=True)} | ${var.desc_repr_md()} | `${var.default}` | ${var.units or ""} |
%endfor
