IPVT
    Abbrevation for Interconnect, Process, Voltage, and Temperature, the four
    components of a timing corner.

timing corner
    A set of simulated physical conditions under which timing analysis is
    performed.

sky130
    The SkyWater Open Source PDK is a collaboration between Google, Efabless and
    SkyWater Technology Foundry to provide a fully open source PDK and related
    resources, which can be used to create manufacturable designs at SkyWaterâ€™s
    facility. The SKY130 is a mature 180nm-130nm hybrid technology originally
    developed internally by Cypress Semiconductor before being spun out into
    SkyWater Technology and made accessible to general industry.

PDK
    Stands for Process Design Kit

RTL
    Stands for Register transfer level

Variable
    An OpenLane configuration variable. It used to control steps and flows.

GDSII
    Stands for Graphic design system. It is a binary stream format which is the
    de facto industry standard for data exchange of integrated circuit or IC layout
    artwork. It was developed by calma company in 1978. A GDSII file contains planar
    geometric shapes, text labels, and other information about the layout in
    hierarchical form. The data can be used to reconstruct all or part of the
    artwork to be used in sharing layouts, transferring artwork between different
    tools, or creating photomasks. It captures all the layout details needed by
    the manfacturer.

KLayout
    A free and open-source layout viewer and editor. For more information visit
    https://www.klayout.de/

OpenROAD
    An open-source tool chain for digital SoC layout generation, focusing on the
    RTL-to-GDSII phase of system-on-chip design. It is used for floorplanning,
    design optimizations, placement, CTS(Clock Tree Synthesis) and routing inside
    OpenLane. For more information visit https://openroad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
