## Installing Dependencies

For OpenLane you need a couple of tools installed:

* Docker 19.03.12+
  * Docker post-installation steps for running without root
* Git 2.35+
* Python 3.8+ with pip and tkinter

Please install all of these dependencies using your package manager. Please note that while alternative container services such as podman do work, they are not officially supported.

### Installing Docker

First, install Docker following the steps provided [in this link](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

Test if installation was successful:

```
sudo docker run hello-world
```

A successful installation of Docker looks like this:

```
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub. (amd64)
3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
$ docker run -it ubuntu bash
