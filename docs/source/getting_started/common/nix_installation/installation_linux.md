## Installing Nix

You can install Nix by following the instructions at https://nixos.org/download.html.

For example, on Ubuntu, run the following your terminal.

```console
sudo apt-get install -y curl
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon --yes
```

```{tip}
If you're using a non-systemd based Linux, you will need to pass `--no-daemon`
instead of `--daemon`. If you do not know what any of that means, you may
safely ignore this tip box.
```

Enter your password if prompted. This should take around 5 minutes.

Make sure to close all terminals after you're done with this step.
