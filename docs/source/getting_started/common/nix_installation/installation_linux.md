## Installing Nix

```{warning}
Do **not** install Nix using `apt`. The version of Nix offered by `apt` is more
often than not severely out-of-date and may cause issues.
```

You will need `curl` to install Nix.

To install curl on Ubuntu, simply type in the following in your terminal:

```console
$ sudo apt-get install -y curl
```

After that, simply run this command:

```console
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix/pr/1145 | sh -s -- install --no-confirm --extra-conf "
    extra-substituters = https://openlane.cachix.org
    extra-trusted-public-keys = openlane.cachix.org-1:qqdwh+QMNGmZAuyeQJTH9ErW57OWSvdtuwfBKdS254E=
"
```

Enter your password if prompted. This should take around 5 minutes.

Make sure to close all terminals after you're done with this step.
