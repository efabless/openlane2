## Installing Nix

You can install Nix by following the instructions at https://nixos.org/download.html.

You may be able to just run this in your terminal:

```console
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --yes
```

Enter your password if prompted. This should take around 5 minutes.

Make sure to close all terminals after you're done with this step.
