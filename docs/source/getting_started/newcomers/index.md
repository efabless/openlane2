# Newcomers

VLSI, or Very Large-Scale Integration, is a cornerstone technology driving the
modern world, silently powering the devices we rely on daily. Its importance
stems from its profound impact on various aspects of our lives, making it
ubiquitous. VLSI facilitated the fabrication of chips. A chip is a small piece
of semiconductor material (usually silicon) containing integrated circuits.
These circuits consist of millions or even billions of tiny switches called
transistors and other electronic components that process information and perform
various functions. These chips are the brains behind countless electronic
devices, from smartphones and computers to cars and medical equipment.

One class of chips is called {term}`ASIC`. ASIC is a type of chip
custom-designed for a specific purpose, unlike general-purpose chips like
microprocessors that can be used for various tasks. One of the most prominent
examples of ASIC is smartphone processors. These chips are custom-designed for
mobile devices, focusing on low power consumption and high performance for
running apps, gaming, and streaming media. They often incorporate specialized
cores for graphics processing, artificial intelligence, and image signal
processing.

Designing an ASIC is a complex and fascinating process that entails various
steps, from idea to the fabrication data. This process is filled with
engineering challenges that require expertise and attention to detail. The
entire process requires significant expertise and experience in chip design and
can take several months to complete. The ASIC design flow is crucial to ensure
successful ASIC design. It is based on a comprehensive understanding of ASIC
specifications, requirements, low-power design, and performance. Engineers can
streamline the process and meet crucial time-to-market goals by following a
proven ASIC design flow. Each stage of the ASIC design cycle is supported by
powerful EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools that facilitate the
implementation of the design. The following are examples of steps needed to
realize an ASIC.

* Design Entry: In this step, the logic design is described using a Hardware
  Description Language (HDL) like System Verilog. Typically, the description is
  done at the data flow (Register Transfer) or behavioral levels.
* Functional Verification: It is essential to catch design errors early on. The
  description must be checked against the requirements, which can be done
  through simulation or formal methods. Functional verification is performed on
  the {term}`RTL` description as well as the netlists generated by the following
  steps.
* Synthesis: In this step, the HDL description is converted into a circuit of
  the logic cells called the Netlist.
* Layout/Physical Synthesis: Also called Physical Implementation. In this step,
  the logic circuit is converted into a layout of the photo masks used for
  fabrication. This complex step involves several sub-steps typically automated
  using its flow. These steps include Floorplanning, Placement, Clock-tree
  synthesis and Routing. Because Placement and Routing are the most
  time-consuming operations, sometimes we refer to this step as "Placement and
  Routing", or {term}`PnR`.
* Signoff: marks the final stage in the rigorous journey of an ASIC's design; it
  ensures your creation functions flawlessly, operates efficiently, and
  ultimately delivers on its promise before sending your chip blueprint off to
  be carved in silicon.

Please note that the five mentioned steps are the major ones. There are several
other design steps that are not mentioned here such as scan chain insertion and
test pattern generations that are essential to testing the fabricated chip
against fabrication defects.

## What is OpenLane?

```{figure} ./flow.webp
:scale: 30 %
:align: right

OpenLane Flow
```

OpenLane is a powerful and versatile infrastructure library that enables the
construction of digital ASIC physical implementation flows based on open-source
and commercial EDA tools. It includes a reference flow (Classic) that is
constructed entirely using open-source EDA tools –abstracting their behavior and
allowing the user to configure them using a single file (See Figure 1). OpenLane
also supports extending or modifying the flow using Python scripts and
utilities. Here are some of the key benefits of using OpenLane:

* Flexibility and extensibility: OpenLane is designed to be flexible and
  extensible, allowing designers to customize the flow to meet their specific
  needs by developing Python scripts (plugins) and utilities or by modifying the
  existing configuration file.
* Open source: OpenLane is an open-source project that is freely available to
  use and modify, which makes it a good choice for designers looking for a
  transparent, cost-effective solution.
* Community support: OpenLane capitalizes on OpenLane's existing community of
  users and contributors, which means that a wealth of resources is available to
  help designers get started and troubleshoot any problems they encounter.

```{seealso}
You may want to check out [OpenLane using Google Colab directly in your browser](https://developers.google.com/silicon/guides/digital-inverter-openlane).

It's free, and there's no need to install anything on your machine!
```

```{note}
This guide assumes that the reader has some basic knowledge of Digital Design,
{term}`ASIC`, the JSON format and {term}`RTL`.
```

______________________________________________________________________

## Installation

1. Follow the instructions in {ref}`nix-based-installation` to
   install {term}`Nix` and set up {term}`Cachix`.

1. Open a terminal and clone OpenLane as follows:

   ```console
   $ git clone https://github.com/efabless/openlane2/ ~/openlane2
   ```

1. Invoke `nix-shell`, which will make all the packages bundled with OpenLane
   available to your shell.

   ```console
   $ nix-shell --pure ~/openlane2/shell.nix
   ```

   Some packages will be downloaded (about 3GiB) and afterwards, the terminal
   prompt should change to:

   ```console
   [nix-shell:~/openlane2]$
   ```

   ```{admonition} Important
   :class: tip

   From now on; all commands assume that you are inside the `nix-shell`.
   ```

1. Run the smoke test to ensure everything is fine. This also downloads
   {term}`sky130` {term}`PDK`.

   ```console
   [nix-shell:~/openlane2]$ openlane --log-level ERROR --condensed --show-progress-bar --smoke-test
   ```

That's it. Everything is ready. Now, let's try OpenLane.

## Running the default flow

### PM32 example

We are going to use a simple design: a 32-bit parallel multiplier which performs
a simple multiplication between MP and MC and outputs the product on a bus P.
MP32 uses a serial-by-parallel multiplier, a serializer, a deserializer, and a
control unit. The block diagram of the PM32 is shown in the next figure.

```{figure} ./pm32.diagram.webp
:scale: 60 %
:align: center

PM32 (32-bit parallel multiplier)
```

The serial-by-parallel signed 32-bit multiplier `SPM` block inside the `PM32`
performs a simple shift-add algorithm, where the parallel input `x` is
multiplied by each bit of the serial input `y` as it is shifted in. The product
is generated and serially output on the wire `p`. Check
[this paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1993.342534) for more information
about the `SPM`.

#### RTL

The source {term}`RTL` of the design will consist of 2 files, which are `spm.v`
and `pm32.v`.

````{dropdown} pm32.v

```{literalinclude} ./pm32.v
:language: verilog
```
````

````{dropdown} spm.v

```{literalinclude} ./spm.v
:language: verilog
```
````

#### Configuration

Designs in OpenLane have configuration files. A configuration file contains
values set by the user for various {py:class}`openlane.config.Variable`(s). With
them, you control the OpenLane flow. This is the configuration file for the
`pm32` design:

````{dropdown} config.json

```json
{
  "DESIGN_NAME": "pm32",
  "VERILOG_FILES": ["dir::pm32.v", "dir::spm.v"],
  "CLOCK_PERIOD": 25,
  "CLOCK_PORT": "clk"
}
```

````

```{warning}
(required-variables)=
For any design, at a minimum you need to specify the following variables:
* {var}`::DESIGN_NAME`
* {var}`Yosys.Synthesis::VERILOG_FILES`
* {var}`::CLOCK_PERIOD`
* {var}`::CLOCK_PORT`
```

```{seealso}
Check out {flow}`the Classic flow's documentation <Classic>` for information about
all available variables.
```

#### How to run?

1. Create a directory to add our source files to:

   ```console
   [nix-shell:~/openlane2]$ mkdir -p ~/my_designs/pm32
   ```

1. Create the file `~/my_designs/pm32/config.json` and add
   [configuration](#configuration) content to it.

1. Create the files `~/my_designs/pm32/pm32.v`, `~/my_designs/pm32/spm.v`, and
   add [RTL](#rtl) content to them.

1. Run the following command:

   ```console
   [nix-shell:~/openlane2]$ openlane ~/my_designs/pm32/config.json
   ```

````{tip}
Double-checking: are you inside a `nix-shell`? Your terminal prompt
should look like this:

```console
[nix-shell:~/openlane2]$
```

If not, enter the following command in your terminal:

```console
$ nix-shell --pure ~/openlane2/shell.nix
```
````

______________________________________________________________________

### Checking the results

#### Viewing the Layout

To open the final {term}`GDSII` layout run this command:

```console
[nix-shell:~/openlane2]$ openlane --last-run --flow openinklayout ~/my_designs/pm32/config.json
```

This opens {term}`KLayout` and you should be able to see the following:

```{figure} ./pm32-gds.webp
:align: center

Final layout of pm32
```

If you wish to view the layout in the {term}`OpenROAD` GUI, try this command
instead:

```console
[nix-shell:~/openlane2]$ openlane --last-run --flow openinopenroad ~/my_designs/pm32/config.json
```

______________________________________________________________________

#### Run directory

You'll find that a **run directory** (named something like
`runs/RUN_2023-12-27_16-59-15`) was created when you ran OpenLane.

By default, OpenLane runs a {py:class}`Flow <openlane.flows.Flow>` composed of a
sequence of {py:class}`Step <openlane.steps.Step>`(s). Each step has its
separate directory within the run directory.

For example, the {step}`OpenROAD.TapEndCapInsertion` Step creates the following
directory `14-openroad-tapendcapinsertion`.

A step directory has log files, report files, {term}`metrics` and output
artifacts created by the step.

For example, these are the contents of `14-openroad-tapendcapinsertion`:

```text
14-openroad-tapendcapinsertion/
├── COMMANDS
├── config.json
├── openroad-tapendcapinsertion.log
├── openroad-tapendcapinsertion.process_stats.json
├── or_metrics_out.json
├── pm32.def
├── pm32.nl.v
├── pm32.odb
├── pm32.pnl.v
├── pm32.sdc
├── state_in.json
└── state_out.json
```

Here is a small description of each of those files:

`````{dropdown} Directory of contents

* `COMMANDS`: any commands run by the step
* `config.json`: a configuration file with all variables accessible by this Step
* `*.log`: log files of subprocesses run by the step
* `*.process_stats.json`: statistics about total elapsed time and resource
  consumption of subprocesses
* `state_in.json`: contains a dictionary of design layout formats (such as {term}`DEF`
  files) and design metrics available as inputs to a step
* `state_out.json`: contains the value `state_out.json` after updates by the step-
  e.g. if a step generates a new DEF file, it would be updated in `state_out.json`.
* `pm32.nl.v`: A Verilog gate-level netlist generated by the step **without**
  power connections
* `pm32.pnl.v`: A Verilog gate-level netlist generated by the step **with**
  power connections
* `pm32.odb`: The current state of the layout saved in the OpenROAD database format
* `pm32.def`: The current state of the layout saved in the DEF format
* `pm32.sdc`: Current constraints on the design saved in the {term}`SDC` format.

````{tip}
Using `state_out.json`, you can view the layout at intermediate steps as well!

```console
[nix-shell:~/openlane2]$ openlane --last-run --flow openinklayout ~/my_designs/pm32/config.json --with-initial-state ~/my_designs/pm32/runs/RUN_2023-12-27_16-59-15/14-openroad-tapendcapinsertion/state_out.json"
```
````

`````

The run directory is composed of many of these step directories:

```text
RUN_2023-12-27_16-59-15
├── 01-verilator-lint/
├── 02-checker-linttimingconstructs/
├── 03-checker-linterrors/

├── 05-yosys-synthesis/
├── 06-checker-yosysunmappedcells/
├── 07-checker-yosyssynthchecks/
├── 08-openroad-checksdcfiles/
├── 09-openroad-staprepnr/
├── 10-openroad-floorplan/
├── 11-odb-setpowerconnections/
├── 12-odb-manualmacroplacement/

├── 15-openroad-globalplacementskipio/
⋮
├── final/
├── tmp
├── error.log
├── info.log
├── resolved.json
└── warning.log
```

#### Final Results

Inside the run directory, you may have noticed there is another, non-specific
step folder named `final`.

`final` contains several directories that contain all the different layout
views produced by the flow. It looks like this:

```text
final
├── def/
├── gds/
├── json_h/
├── klayout_gds/
├── lef/
├── lib/
├── mag/
├── mag_gds/
├── nl/
├── odb/
├── pnl/
├── sdc/
├── sdf/
├── spef/
├── spice/
├── metrics.csv
└── metrics.json
```

Moreover, it contains `metrics.csv` and `metric.json` which represent the final
metrics in `JSON` and {term}`CSV` formats.

### Signoff Steps

An ASIC design’s signoff is the last phase of its implementation. It involves
physical and timing verifications before committing to the silicon manufacturing
process, which is commonly known as "design tape-out".

OpenLane runs a couple of Step(s) for the final signoff.

1. [DRC](#drc)
1. [LVS](#lvs)
1. [STA](#sta)
1. [Antenna Check](#antenna-check)

#### DRC

{term}`DRC` stands for Design Rule Checking which checks, against rules set by
chip foundries, that the layout has to satisfy in order to be manufacturable,
such as checking for minimum allowed spacing between two `met1` shapes.

OpenLane runs two DRC steps using `Magic` and `KLayout`: {step}`Magic.DRC` and
`KLayout.DRC`. Both tools have blind spots that are covered by the other tools.

Both the layout and what is known as a PDK's {term}`DRC deck` are processed by
the tools running DRC, as shown in the diagram below:

```{figure} ./OL-DRC.webp
:align: center
:scale: 50 %

DRC (Design Rule Checking) Flow
```

If DRC violations are found; OpenLane will generate an error reporting the total
count of violations found by each Step.

To view DRC errors graphically, you may open the layout as follows:

```console
[nix-shell:~/openlane2]$ openlane --last-run --flow openinklayout ~/my_designs/pm32/config.json
```

Then in the menu bar select Tools ► Marker Browser. A new window should open.

```{figure} ./klayout-markerbrowser.webp
:align: center

Tools ► Marker Browser
```

Click File ► Open and then select the DRC report file, of which you'll find two:
One under `52-magic-drc/reports/drc.klayout.xml` and the other under
`53-klayout-drc/report/drc.klayout.xml`.

```{tip}
The initial number in `53-klayout-drc` (`53`) may vary according to the
flow's configuration.
```

```{figure} ./klayout-markerbrowser-2.webp
:align: center

Opening DRC xml file
```

#### LVS

{term}`LVS` stands for Layout Versus Schematic. It compares the layout
{term}`GDSII` or DEF/LEF, with the schematic which is usually in
{term}`Verilog`, ensuring that connectivity in both views matches.
Sometimes, user configuration or even the tools have errors and such a check is
important to catch them.

Common LVS errors include but are not limited to:

* Shorts: Two or more wires that should not be connected have been and must be
  separated. The most problematic is power and ground shorts.
* Opens: Wires or components that should be connected are left dangling or only
  partially connected. These must be connected properly.
* Missing Components: An expected component has been left out of the layout.

`Netgen.LVS` is the Step run for LVS using a tool called {term}`Netgen`. First,
the layout is converted to {term}`SPICE netlist`. Next, the layout and the
schematic are inputted to Netgen, as shown in the diagram below:

```{figure} ./OL-LVS.webp
:scale: 50 %
:align: center

LVS (Layout-versus-Schematic) Flow
```

`Netgen` will generate multiple files that can be browsed in case of LVS errors.
As with all Step(s), these will be inside the Step's directory.

You would want to look at `netgen-lvs.log` which has a summary of the results of
`LVS`. Ideally, you would find the following at the end of this log file:

```text
Final result:
Circuits match uniquely.
```

In case of errors, there is also `lvs.rpt` which is more detailed. Inside it,
you will find tables comparing nodes between the layout and the schematic. On
the left is the layout (`GDS`) and the schematic (Verilog) is on the other side.
Here is a sample of these tables:

```text
Subcircuit summary:
Circuit 1: pm32                             |Circuit 2: pm32
-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------
sky130_fd_sc_hd__tapvpwrvgnd_1 (102->1)    |sky130_fd_sc_hd__tapvpwrvgnd_1 (102->1)
sky130_fd_sc_hd__decap_3 (144->1)          |sky130_fd_sc_hd__decap_3 (144->1)
sky130_fd_sc_hd__inv_2 (64)                |sky130_fd_sc_hd__inv_2 (64)
sky130_fd_sc_hd__nand2_1 (31)              |sky130_fd_sc_hd__nand2_1 (31)
sky130_fd_sc_hd__dfrtp_1 (64)              |sky130_fd_sc_hd__dfrtp_1 (64)
sky130_ef_sc_hd__decap_12 (132->1)         |sky130_ef_sc_hd__decap_12 (132->1)
```

#### STA

STA stands for Static Timing Analysis. The STA tool identifies the design timing
paths and then calculates the data's earliest and latest actual and required
arrival times at every timing path endpoint. If the data arrives after (in case
of setup checking) or before (hold checking) it is required, then we have a
timing violation (negative slack). STA makes sure that a circuit will correctly
perform its function (but tells nothing about the correctness of that function.)

```{figure} ./STA.webp
:align: center
:scale: 50 %

STA (Static Timing Analysis) Flow
```

The default flow runs a step called {step}`OpenROAD.STAPostPNR` for STA
signoff.

```{note}
During the flow the step {step}`OpenROAD.STAMidPNR` is ran multiple times 
The results are not as accurate as `OpenROAD.STAPostPNR` since the design 
is not fully implemented yet. However, they provide a better sense of the impact
multiple stages of the flow (such as optimizations steps) on STA results for the
design.
```

Inside the Step directory, there is a file called `summary.rpt` which summarizes
important metrics for each {term}`IPVT` {term}`timing corner`:

```{admonition} More about IPVT corners
:class: tip

IPVT corners stands for Interconnect, Process, Voltage, and Temperature corners. Interconnect corners take into account variations in interconnect width, thickness, and height, as well as the dielectric properties of the materials surrounding them. Interconnect variations affect the signal delay, power dissipation, and cross-talks. PVT corners represent the extreme conditions of manufacturing process variations, operating voltage fluctuations, and temperature ranges an IC might experience. These corners are used to simulate the worst-case scenarios to ensure that the IC functions correctly under all possible conditions. For instance, a slow process corner combined with low voltage, high temperature, and maximum interconnect delay could represent a worst-case scenario for timing, leading to slower transistor speeds hence more likely to have setup violations. On the other hand, a fast process corner combined with high voltage, low temperature, and min interconnects could represent the fastest scenario for timing, which is more likely to have hold violations. If we go back to the STA summary table, the worst setup slack is in the max_ss_100C_1v60 which has the maximum interconnect delay, slow device process, high temperature (100 Celsius), and low voltage (1.60V). Alternatively, the worst hold slack is in the min_ff_n40C_1v95 which has the minimum interconnect delay, fast device process, low temperature (negative 40 Celsius), and high voltage (1.95V).
```

There is also a directory per corner inside the Step directory which contains
all the log files and reports generated for each `IPVT corner`.

* `min.rpt`: Constrained paths for hold checks.

* `max.rpt`: Constrained paths for setup checks.

* `skew.min.rpt`: Maximum clock skew for hold checks.

* `skew.max.rpt`: Maximum clock skew for setup checks.

* `tns.min.rpt`: Total negative hold slack.

* `tns.max.rpt`: Total negative setup slack.

* `wns.min.rpt`: Worst negative hold slack.

* `wns.max.rpt`: Worst negative setup slack.

* `ws.min.rpt`: Worst hold slack.

* `ws.max.rpt`: Worst setup slack.

* `violator_list.rpt` Setup and hold violator endpoints.

* `checks.rpt`: It contains a summary of the following checks:

  1. Max capacitance violations
  1. Max slew violations
  1. Max fanout violations
  1. Unconstrained paths
  1. Unannotated and partially annotated nets
  1. Checks the SDC for combinational loops, register/latch with multiple clocks
     or no clocks, ports missing input delay, and generated clocks
  1. Worst setup or hold violating path

#### Antenna Check

Long metal wire segments that are connected to a transistor gate may damage the
transistor's thin gate oxide during the fabrication process due to its collection of
charges from the processing environment. This is called the antenna effect
(Also, called Plasma Induced Gate Oxide Damage). Chip foundries normally supply
antenna rules, which are rules that must be obeyed to avoid this problem. The
rules limit the ratio of collection area and drainage (thin oxide) area. Antenna
effect can be avoided by instructing the router to use short wire segments and
to create bridges to disconnect long from transistor gates during fabrication.
This approach is not used by OpenLane as OpenROAD routers don't support this
methodology. Instead, OpenLane uses another approach that involves the insertion
of an antenna diode (provided as a standard cell) next to the cell input pin
that suffers from the antenna effect. Antenna diode cell has a reversed biased
diode which can drain out the charge without affecting the transistor circuitry.

```

The default flow runs a step called {step}`OpenROAD.CheckAntennas` to check for
antenna rules violations.

```{note}
The checker runs thrice during the flow:
1. Once immediately after global routing
2. Once as part of the {step}`OpenROAD.RepairAntennas` composite step
3. During signoff

First two are ran to see the impact of antenna repair step.
```

Inside the step directory of {step}`OpenROAD.CheckAntennas`, there is a `reports`
directory that contains two files; the full antenna check report from
`OpenROAD` and a summary table of antenna violations:

### Adding custom pin placement configuration

As seen in the previous layout, the pins of the `pm32` macro are placed
randomly. If this macro will be integrated into a larger macro or chip, the pin
placement should be according to the top-level connectivity. For example, if the
clock pin will be derived from a clocking macro that will be placed on the east
side of this macro, then the clock pin in the `pm32` should be placed on the
east side. In order to change pin placement, we can add a pin placement
configuration file to our flow as follows:

1. Create the file `~/my_designs/pm32/pin_order.cfg`
1. Add the following content to it

````{dropdown} pin_order.cfg

```cfg
#E
clk
rst
start
done

#S
mc.*
mp.*

#N
p.*
```
````

3. Add `"FP_PIN_ORDER_CFG": "dir::pin_order.cfg"` to the config.json so the new
   config file will be like this

````{dropdown} config.json

```json
{
  "DESIGN_NAME": "pm32",
  "VERILOG_FILES": ["dir::pm32.v", "dir::spm.v"],
  "CLOCK_PERIOD": 25,
  "CLOCK_PORT": "clk",
  "FP_PIN_ORDER_CFG": "dir::pin_order.cfg"
}
```
````

4. Run the flow again using the following command:

```console
[nix-shell:~/openlane2]$ openlane ~/my_designs/pm32/config.json
```

5. Check the final layout again using this command:

```console
[nix-shell:~/openlane2]$ openlane --last-run --flow openinklayout ~/my_designs/pm32/config.json
```

Since the configuration file `pin_order.cfg` has `#E` then `clk`, `rst`,
`start`, then `done`, we will find those 4 pins on the east side of the macro.
Similarly, we will find `mc` and `mp` buses on the south and `p` on the north of
the macro.
