# Contributing Docs

## Introduction

Documentation plays an important role in OpenLane.
Good documentation should cover as much information as possible,
while staying readable, up-to-date and clean.

This page covers installation of required tools
and outlines simple principles to be followed when writing documentation.

:::{note}
To simply fix typos, you do not need to install anything. Pull requests can be created from the relevant ReadTheDocs page, using GitHub's editor.
:::

For more complex documentation, it is recommended to follow these steps:

1. Read this guide
1. Either create a new page in `docs/source/`. Then you need to add your page to the Table of Contents in `index.md`
1. ... or open an existing one in the same folder.
1. Follow these guidelines:
   : - Begin with the general structure of the documentation. This step ensures continuity with the rest of the documentation and allows the writer to better organize their thoughts.
   * Use reStructuredText and existing plugins to write the documentation.
   * Create as much visual documentation as possible. More is better.
   * Pictures, figures, tables significantly improve the quality of documentation and make the documentation available for beginners.
   * Add links to references, guide and pointers to other available documentation or books.
1. Use [Building documentation locally](#building-documentation-locally) to preview and visualize the documentation.
1. Copy the text from preview into an editor that highlights the mistakes and fix them.
1. Rebuild documentation and repeat.
1. Once satisfied, commit the changes to your repository using git.
1. Create a pull request to the main repository, so the maintainers can review your changes.
1. Maintainers may request some tweaks (or do the tweaks themselves.) Execute them and then push the changes again.
1. Once changes are approved they will be merged and then you can delete your branch or repository.

## Building documentation locally

A Python virtual environment will need to be created in `<OPENLANE_ROOT>/venv` as follows:

```sh
make venv
```

After installation, every time you want to build the documentation proceed to enter the venv and run `sphinx-build` following commands:

```sh
cd OpenLane/
make docs
```

View the generated html files using your favorite web browser. Open this document in browser:

```sh
# Assuming same folder as OpenLane
cd OpenLane/

# macOS
open docs/build/html/docs/source/contributing_to_docs.html

# Most GNU/Linux Distributions
xdg-open docs/build/html/docs/source/contributing_to_docs.html
```

Documentation [regarding reStructuredText can be found here:](https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Documentation organization

All of the documentation is concentrated in `docs/`.
Static files for a certain document are stored in `docs/_static` in its respective directory: for example, screenshots for this guide are located in `docs/_static/docs_contrbution`,
while the screenshots for the installation guide are located in `docs/_static/installation`.

Directory `docs/source/` contains all of the page's content.
You can add pages by creating the corresponding file in that folder.
Then you need to add your page to the Table of Contents in `index.md`.
Or if you want it to be in category, then modify the Table of Contents of said category.
If you want to create new category than take a look at the source code of existing category.

## Writing Style and Consistency

* New documentation should be written in \[MyST Markdown\](<https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>), a flavor of Markdown with some RST extensions.
* Use `of` instead of `'`, for example: `Docker's Installation` → `after the installation of Docker`.
* Avoid contractions: Substitute `don't` and `can't` for `do not` and `cannot`
* The first command of the page should have `cd` in it to specify where you are running and all following commands assume the continuation of the session and don't need the cd command.
* Avoid using same header type both for the title of the document and its content. It looks awful in the table of content.
  * To that end, only use `#` once at the beginning of the document.

### Term Consistency

In order to improve the readability of the documentation, please use and capitalize names and trademarks properly. Some examples you can see below:

```
OpenLANE → OpenLane
OpenRoad → OpenROAD
Mac OS X → macOS
MAGIC → Magic
Skywater130 → sky130
Klayout → KLayout
Pip -> pip
```

* For technical terms, use the following terms preferred by OpenROAD documentation for consistency:

```
co-ordinates → coordinates
pad ring → padring
pad cell → padcell
key value pair → key-value pair
micrometre → micron (or, micrometer)
```

:::{note}
Also, when documenting micrometer-based variables, use the actual Unicode character "µ", not "u", to avoid potential confusion. It's Alt+230 on Windows, Alt+M on macOS and on Linux, press the Compose Key then type `mu`.
:::

### Taking screenshots

The screenshots in documentation should use following prompt:

```sh
export PS1="\W> "
```

You can add it to your `.bashrc` (or your shell's RC file) or just run it before you run the command.

:::{note}
Please note that taking screenshots for terminal output is not recommended. You may want to use a `code-block` object.

## Troubleshooting

### `pip` module related errors

If you're running `sphinx-build` manually and did not source `../venv/bin/activate` before running `sphinx-build` then you may run into an error similar to the one below.

```sh
Running Sphinx v5.0.1

Configuration error:
There is a programmable error in your configuration file:

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/user/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sphinx/config.py", line 343, in eval_config_file
    exec(code, namespace)
File "/home/user/Desktop/openlane/conf.py", line 24, in <module>
    from recommonmark.parser import CommonMarkParser
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'recommonmark'
```

In order to resolve this, repeat the steps above for enabling venv.
