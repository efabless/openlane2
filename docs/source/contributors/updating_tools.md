# Updating Tools

To update tools bundled with OpenLane, their respective `.nix` files need to be
updated. The relevant `.nix` files all exist under the `nix/` folder under the
root of the OpenLane repo.

## Setting up the OpenLane Nix Cache

If you somehow haven't done so already, follow the instructions in
[**Nix Installation**](../getting_started/common/nix_installation/installation_linux.md#setting-up-the-binary-cache)
to enable the OpenLane-specific binary cache.

## Finding the Current Version Info

First, find the `.nix` file for your tool. For OpenROAD, for example, it is
`openroad.nix`.

There are four primary values in the nix object (called a "derivation")
that decide the version being used (all strings):

* `owner`: The name of the GitHub tool repository owner.
* `repo`: The name of the GitHub tool repository.
* `rev`: By convention, the Git commit of the tool in question.
  * Technically, versions, tags and branches are also accepted, but none are
    deemed consistent enough to use with OpenLane.
* `sha256` (or `hash`): A sha256sum of the contents of the repository in use
  when said commit is downloaded without any `.git` files.

Let's take `openroad.nix` as an example:

```{literalinclude} ../../../nix/openroad.nix
---
language: nix
start-after: name = "openroad";
end-before: cmakeFlagsAll = [
---
```

## Changing Version Info

Start by doing two things:

1. Finding the version you want to update to in the target repository.

Since we're updating OpenROAD, going to https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/commits/master
will give us a list of commits. The easiest way to get the commit hash in
question is to just click on a commit…

![Clicking on the commit value in a Git commit list](./commit_list.webp)

…and then copy the hash from the URL:

![Copying the hash from the URL](./commit.webp)

2. Updating the version in the Nix derivation

Change the value of `rev` to match the hash you just copied, and then set the
value of `sha256` to an empty string (`""`).

```{warning}
Do not leave the `sha256` field unchanged. Nix attempts to find downloaded files
in its cache by hash first, and if the hash does not change it will not attempt
to re-download the Git repository, essentially ensuring you will waste time
re-building a Git repository you've previously downloaded, while substituting a
mismatched revision string to boot.
```

3. Invoke `nix-shell` and wait. Depending on the tools's repository size and your internet connection, this will take a while.

You will then encounter an error that looks something like this:

```
error: hash mismatch in fixed-output derivation '/nix/store/2x8jfn70v4ahvvcdbcaiz0zwz0jh02z4-source.drv':
         specified: sha256-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=
            got:    sha256-zQVs4u0x1Lh1gs0xm9eJHc36LQNzlWFMpLVRzOOdhmU=
```

Copy the value from "got": in this case, `sha256-zQVs4u0x1Lh1gs0xm9eJHc36LQNzlWFMpLVRzOOdhmU=`,
and use it as the value for `sha256`:

```nix
  sha256 = "sha256-zQVs4u0x1Lh1gs0xm9eJHc36LQNzlWFMpLVRzOOdhmU=";
```

4. Invoke `nix-shell` again

You'll notice that the Git clone was not repeated, and the build should start.

That's pretty much it. Just wait and the resulting nix shell will contain the
new version of the utility.

If it errors out, this may be because of one of the following:

* The build methodology for the tool has changed
  * You will need to update more elements in the Nix derivation, which will
    require understanding Nix. See [**Further Reading**](#further-reading) below
    for more information on how to learn to do that.
* An internet connectivity issue
  * Nix will automatically download derivations it needs from various servers,
    including but not limited to the Nix Store, Cachix, and GitHub. If there
    is a temporarily failure accessing any of them, the build will fail.
* Memory corruption or other hardware failure
  * Restarting the build should work, build you can also try `nix-shell --cores 1`
    to limit the stress on your hardware.
