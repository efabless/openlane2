## Introduction

Timing closure is the process of satisfying timing constraints for clocked
elements through design transformations. Clocked elements such as flip-flops
have constraints that must be satisfied. The data fed to a flip-flop must be
stable before the clock edge and after the clock edge. As shown in
{numref}`ff-parameters`, the setup time constraint is the amount of time
required for the input to a flip-flop to be stable before a clock edge. The hold
time constraint is the minimum amount of time needed for the input to a
flip-flop to be stable after a clock edge. Also, shows the delay time to change
the flip-flop output relative to the arrival of the triggering clock edge. This
delay is typically referred to as $ t_{CQ} $ (time from C to Q). Not satisfying
the flip-flop setup and/or hold times constraints will make the flip-flop
metastable. This means the data stored in the flip-flop is unknown, which means
the state of the whole system becomes unknown.

### Timing Paths

To achieve a timing closure, timing violations must be identified and fixed.
Determining the timing violations is typically done using static timing analysis
(STA) tools. The STA tool (e.g., OpenSTA) identifies the design timing paths and
then calculates the data earliest and latest actual and required arrival times
(AAT and RAT) at every timing path endpoint. If the data arrives after (in case
of setup checking) or before (hold checking) it is required, then we have a
timing violation (negative slack).

There are four types of timing paths for a given design unit based on the type
of the starting and ending points of the timing path. A timing path may start at
the clock pin of a flip-flop or an input port. It ends at the data input pin (D)
of a flip-flop or an output port. Hence there are four types of timing paths
({numref}`timing-paths`):

* Input to output (in-to-out)
* Input to flip-flop (in-to-reg)
* Flip-flop to output (reg-to-out)
* Flip-flop to Flip-flop (reg-to-reg)
  * The first flip-flop is alternately referred to as the input or data release
    flip-flop, and the second is referred to as the output or data capture
    flip-flop.

The last three timing path types are actually flip-flop to flip-flop timing
paths where the release, capture, or both are outside the design unit, as shown
in {numref}`r2r`.

### Modeling CMOS Cells

Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology is the mainstream
technology for digital circuits implementation. A CMOS logic gate (also called a
cell) is made of complementary and symmetrical pairs of p-type and n-type
MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors) called the pull-up
and pull-down networks (PUN and PDN). The PUN is made of p-type MOSFETS (pMOS
transistors), and the PDN is made of n-type MOSFETS (nMOS transistors). The PUN
acts as a programmable switch that connects the output of the CMOS gate to VDD
when the boolean function implemented by the gate produces logic 1. The PDN
connects the output to GND when the boolean function produces logic 0.
{numref}`nand2-cmos-rc` shows the PUN and the PDN and the RC model of a 2-input
CMOS nand2 cell. The RC model is an approximate model used for delay
calculations. In this model, every input pin has a capacitance equivalent to the
sum of the gate capacitances of the MOSFETs connected to the pin. The PUN is
modeled as a switch and a resistance, the same for the PDN. The diffusion
capacitances of the MOSFETs connected to the cell output are modeled as a single
internal (also called intrinsic) capacitance ($ C_{int} $`) at the cell output.

```{figure} ./nand2_cmos_rc.webp
:name: nand2-cmos-rc
:align: center
:width: 1000px

NAND2 CMOS Cell Electrical RC Model
```

When the CMOS cell output switches state, the switching speed is governed by how
fast the capacitance on the output net can be charged or discharged. The
capacitance on the output net is the sum of the parasitic capacitance, the
interconnects (wires) capacitances, and the pin capacitances of the cells driven
by this cell, as shown in Figure 5. The cell delay can be approximated as the
product of the PUN/PDN resistance and the sum of the intrinsic and load
capacitances. As $ R_{PUN} $ can be different from $ R_{PDN} $ the rising
$ t_{pdr} $ and falling $ t_{pdf} $ delays are different.

$$ t_{pdr} = R_{PUN} (C_{in} + C_{load}) \\ t_{pdf} = R_{PDN} (C_{in} +
C_{load}) $$

```{note}
A wire is assumed to be equivalent to a single capacitance.
This is only valid for short wires with no vias. In reality, a wire has a lumped
resistance and a lumped capacitance. Both rely on the wire dimensions; the
longer the wire, the higher the resistance and the capacitance.
{numref}`routing-layer-rc` lists the resistance and the capacitance per micro
for every routing layer in the sky130 PDK.

### Timing Constraints

As a designer, you need to specify the design constraints (intents) to help
different EDA tools carry out their jobs (optimization and analysis) during the
implementation process. The constraints are expressed using statements that are
based on the TCL language. These commands have an industry-standard which is
called SDC (Synopsys Design Constraints) format. The SDC format also covers
statements that specify timing exceptions, such as false paths and multi-cycle
paths. Please refer to OpenSTA documentation {cite}`cherry_opensta_2024` for
more information. Here are some examples of basic SDC constraints:

* The clock definition (`create_clock`)

* Delays for input and output ports relative to the clocks (`set_input_delay`
  and `set_output_delay`)

* The load on output ports (`set_load`)

* The driving cells for input ports (`set_drive`)

A false path is a timing path that exists in the circuit but will never be
exercised. For example, in {numref}`false-path`, the path from DIN to DOUT will
never be exercised because the selection of MUX2 complements the selection of
MUX1; hence, MUX1 and MUX2 can't select A simultaneously. To set the false path
use: set_false_path -through w1 -through w2

How about multi-cycle paths? Generally, the combinational path between a launch
flip-flop and a capture flip-flop takes only one clock cycle to propagate the
data. However, in some cases, it could take more than a single clock cycle to
propagate the data through the combinational data path. This is known as a
multi-cycle path. In a normal path (non-multi-cycle) the setup check is
performed at the destination FF one cycle after launching the data and the hold
check is performed at the destination at the same edge that released the data as
shown in {numref}`multi-cycle-path`.

```{figure} ./false_path.webp

False Path Example
```

```{figure} ./multi_cycle_path.webp
:name: multi-cycle-path
:align: center
:width: 1000px

Constraining a Multi-Cycle Path
```

For a multi-cycle path that takes N cycles, the setup check is performed after N
cycles at the destination and hold check is performed after N-1 cycles. Assuming
the combinational data path takes two clock cycles to propagate data to the
capture flip-flop, then there should be a multi-cycle path defined for the setup
and hold checks between launch and capture flip-flops as follows:

```tcl
// multi-cycle from setup check for launching to capturing clock

set_multicycle_path -setup 2 -from [get_pins launch_ff/Q] -to [get_pins
capture_ff/D]

// multi-cycle from hold check for launching to capturing clock

set_multicycle_path -hold 1 -from [get_pins launch_ff/Q] -to [get_pins
capture_ff/D]
```

To understand how to check whether the setup and hold constraints are met or
not, let's consider the circuit and timing diagram in Figure 8. In this circuit
the clock is skewed by the value t_{skew}. The clock skew is defined as the
difference in clock arrival times to flip-flops. Here the clock edge arrives at
the release flip-flop (U11) before the capture flip-flop (U14). In this scenario
the skew is referred to as a positive skew. To observe a negative skew, the
clock edge has to reach the release flip-flop after it reaches the capture
flip-flop. In order for the capture flip-flop (U14) to function correctly the
data released by U11 should arrive within the green window. If the data arrives
early, hold constraint is violated and if it arrives late setup constraint is
violated. The STA tool calculates the AAT of data to U14 for setup constraint
check as follows:

```{figure} rat_att.webp
:name: rat-att-calc
:align: center
:width: 1000px

RAT and AAT Calculation for Setup Constraint Check
```

To understand how to check whether the setup and hold constraints are met or
not, let's consider the circuit and timing diagram in {numref}`rat-att-calc`. In
this circuit the clock is skewed by the value $ t_{skew} $. The clock skew is
defined as the difference in clock arrival times to flip-flops. Here the clock
edge arrives at the release FF (U11) before the capture FF (U14). In this
scenario the skew is referred to as a positive skew. To observe a negative skew,
the clock edge has to reach the release flip-flop after it reaches the capture
flip-flop. In order for the capture flip-flop (U14) to function correctly the
data released by U14 should arrive within the green window. If the data arrives
early, hold constraint is violated and if it arrives late setup constraint is
violated. The STA tool calculates the AAT of data to U14 for setup constraint
check as follows:

(1) $ AAT_{latest} = t_{ck} + t_{CQ} + t_{and} + t_{inv} + t_{xor} $

The required time is calculated using the following:

(2) $ RAT_{s} = t_{ck} + t_{skew} - t_{s} $

To satisfy the setup constraint, the latest AAT should be less than RAT_{s}. In
another words:

(3) $ SLACK_{s} = RAT_{s} - ATT_{latest} > 0 $

For hold constraint check, we use the earliest arrival time

(4) $ AAT_{earliest} = t_{ck} + t_{CQ} + t_{xor} $

and the required time can be calculated

(5) $ RAT_{h} = t_{skew} + t_{h} $

To satisfy the hold constraint, the earliest AAT should be larger than the $
RAT_{h} $, which means:

(6) $ SLACK_{s} = ATT_{earliest} - RAT_{h} > 0 $

### Timing Optimizations

When a violation is identified for a timing path, design transformations such as
buffering, sizing, cloning, clock skewing, etc., are performed to ensure that
the slack is zero or positive. During physical implementation (also called Place
and Route or PnR), these transformations are done after placement and/or global
routing. They result in modification of the netlist. Illustrations of some
commonly used optimizations are given in {numref}`common-optimizations`.

Typically, a standard cell library (SCL) contains multiple sizes of the same
cell. For example, the Sky130 HD SCL contains several versions of the nand2
(2-input NAND) cell for the sizes 1, 2, 4, and 8. The cell name reflects its
size, for example size 4 nand2 cell is named `sky130_fd_sc_hd__nand2_4` where
the `_4` postfix reflects its size. The cell size indicates its driving strength
which determines how much current it can provide to its load. This means the
higher the driving strength, the lower the cell delay for a given capacitive
load. Please note that increasing the size of a cell increases its loading
effect on its driver. This means sizing a cell up to reduce its delay is
associated with the increase of its driving cell delay.

The buffer is a typical SCL that plays an essential role in circuit timing. A
buffer is nothing but two inverters connected back to back, which does not
perform any logic function. However, as a CMOS circuit, it produces the input
signal. Hence, it generates an excellent sharp digital signal from an input
signal with a long transition time. Also, a buffer can reduce the timing effects
of long wires by dividing it into smaller segments. Moreover, it can be used to
insert delays to the data path to fix hold violations.

## Tips for Achieving Timing Closure

OpenLane supports automatic timing closure; the {flow}`Classic` flow applies
design optimizations that favor hold violations fixing after CTS and after
global routing. These optimizations are controlled using some flow
configurations such as those given by {numref}`timing-related-config-vars`.

```{list-table} OpenLane Timing-related Configuration Variables
:name: timing-related-config-vars
:header-rows: 1

* - Parameter
  - Use
* - {var}`Classic::RUN_POST_CTS_RESIZER_TIMING`
  - Specifies whether design timing optimizations should be performed immediately
    after placement and CTS or not.

    optimizer not to stop at zero slack and try to achieve a positive timing

```

```{tip}
Click on the variable names in the table above to get the default values.
```

TheClassic flow performs STA at several points throughout the flow by using the
following steps:

* {step}`OpenROAD.STAPrePNR`
* {step}`OpenROAD.STAMidPNR`
* {step}`OpenROAD.STAPostPNR`

As the IDs imply, The first of the steps runs before PnR, i.e., using the
synthesized netlist and OpenROAD's bundled OpenSTA. The second runs multiple
times at different points in the flow using the in-progress floorplan. The final
runs using the post-PnR netlist with parasitics extracted from the final
floorplan, giving the most accurate timing analysis of the final manufacturable
design.

Each of these steps generates a number of reports, which can be found under
`runs/<RUN_NAME>/<STEP_ID>`. The reports contain useful timing information. For
example `wns.max.rpt` contains the setup worst negative slack:

```
===========================================================================
Worst Negative Slack (Setup)
============================================================================
nom_tt_025C_1v80: 0.0
```

The files `max.rpt` and `min.rpt` contain the timing reports for setup and hold
constraint analysis (respectively) sorted by the slack (worst first). Here is
one such example showing a timing path from the `max.rpt` report:

```

```

The report snippet in Figure 12 contains a timing report for one of the min
timing paths. The report for any timing path is comprised of 4 sections:

* The header: contains basic information about the timing path, such as the
  start and endpoints
* Data arrival: Shows cells and interconnect delay information from the start
  point to the endpoint
* Data required: Gives information about when the data is needed at the
  endpoint.
* The Slack: The difference between data required and data arrival times.

However hard OpenLane tries to achieve automatic timing closure; it may not work
as expected in rare cases. Here are some tips to aid you in achieving timing
closure:

1. OpenLane sets some timing constraints through configuration variables (clock
   definition, input and output delays, load on output ports, driving cell for
   input ports, and maximum allowed transition). However, it is your
   responsibility to complete the constraints by providing an SDC file custom
   constraints. The custom SDC file can define timing exceptions and specify
   different constraints for input and output ports. Use the flow configuration
   variable `PNR_SDC_FILE` to point to an SDC file for pre/mid PnR steps, and
   {var}`OpenROAD.STAPostPNR::SIGNOFF_SDC_FILE` to point to an SDC file for
   {step}`OpenROAD.STAPostPNR`.
   * Having different PnR and signoff SDC files is useful for when you want to
     over-constrain the PnR steps to possibly achieve better results then
     perform timing analysis with realistic constraints.
1. OpenLane assumes a single clock domain. Suppose you have multiple clock
   domains in the same design. In that case, it is your responsibility to adjust
   the constraints and other OpenLane components to handle them correctly.
1. STA performed immediately after the synthesis stage will not report any hold
   violations as the clock is considered an ideal net; hence there will be no
   clock skews to cause hold violations. However, you may have setup violations.
   You can see hold violations at this stage only if your HDL model has an
   embedded clock tree.
1. If your design does not have a hard requirement for the clock frequency (for
   example, USB 1.1 IP core requires a 48MHz system clock to comply with USB
   specifications), focus on hold violations as your chip can be completely
   non-functional because of hold violations. In this case, adjust the clock
   period to eliminate the setup violations. You may use the configuration
   variables: {var}`OpenROAD.ResizerTimingPostCTS::PL_RESIZER_ALLOW_SETUP_VIOS`
   and {var}`OpenROAD.ResizerTimingPostGRT::GRT_RESIZER_ALLOW_SETUP_VIOS` to
   instruct the timing optimizer to prioritize hold violations fixing over setup
   violations fixing.
1. Hold violations are, mainly, caused by clock skew (difference in clock
   arrival times to flip-flops). A good clock tree will ease things. It is
   impossible to synthesize a perfectly balanced clock tree to achieve zero
   clock skew. It is always good to check the clock skew report and address
   issues causing high skew (for example, wrong placement of a macro). It was
   found that limiting the clock buffer sizes during CTS through the
   configuration variable {var}`OpenROAD.CTS::CTS_CLK_BUFFERS` helps balance the
   clock tree.
1. Timing optimizations increase the design cell area (hence, the design core
   utilization) due to cell sizing and buffer insertions. To not explode the
   design size, timing optimizations stop after inserting buffers after a
   certain percentage of buffer insertions. This percentage is controlled by the
   flow configuration variables mentioned in the table above-- if you increase
   the percentage of buffer insertions, it is recommended to re-run the flow
   with a lower core utilization (use {var}`OpenROAD.Floorplan::FP_CORE_UTIL`)
   to avoid routing congestions.
1. Spend good time identifying false paths. This is highly dependent on your
   understanding of the RTL code. EDA tools will fix violations on False paths
   if they are not instructed not to do so. This will lead to unnecessary
   optimizations that may explode the design size and/or prevent optimizing True
   paths.
1. Setup and hold violations may be reported on false paths during STA. Review
   your violating paths carefully. Update your constraints to include False
   paths if you find any.
1. It is recommended that you simulate the final gate-level netlist with SDF
   (Standard Delay Format) annotations. This simulation is the closest to what
   you see from the fabricated chip. Moreover, timing simulation can help
   identify false paths. Section 3 gives an overview of how to perform this.
1. Violating maximum capacitance and maximum transition constraints are OK if
   you don't have setup/hold vios. It is always good to check them as they are
   indicators of design issues. For example, a high capacitance on a net means
   high fanout and/or long interconnect. Also, high transition time means a high
   capacitive load and leads to a higher short circuit power and delays.

## SDF Annotated GL Simulation using CVC

Standard Delay Format ({term}`SDF`) is an {term}`IEEE` standard for representing and
interpreting timing data for use at any stage of an electronic design process.
Typically SDF files are generated by static timing analysis tools and used with
simulators for gate-level simulation with timing information. The SDF file
contains the timing information of all the cells in the design. It is used to
provide timing information for simulating the gate-level netlist. Simulation
using timing information is a time-consuming process, and it cannot replace STA.
Timing simulation can be helpful to uncover false paths and validate them.

OpenLane has support for SDF generation (found under results/final/sdf/ folder).
To use the generated SDF file in simulation, you need to update your testbench
to add a line similar to the following line (inside any initial block) for each
macro in your design.

```verilog
$sdf_annotate("design.sdf", design_instance_name_in_the_tb);
```

Unfortunately, popular open-source Verilog simulators don't have support for SDF
(Verilator) or have limited support that is not entirely useful (iverilog).
However, there is a less popular free-of-charge Verilog simulator called CVC by
Tachyon DA {cite}`noauthor_cvc_nodate` that has decent support for timing
simulation using SDF files. CVC is a proprietary "shared source"[^4] simulator,
but its license allows using it freely for non-commercial designs.

OpenLane does not include CVC, so you will have to compile it separately. To run
timing simulation using CVC, invoke the following:

```console
$ cvc +interp +dump2fst <YOUR_NETLIST.v> +incdir+<PATH_TO_SCL_MODEL_FILES>
```

While running the simulation CVC may display messages if timing violations are
caught by cell models checkers. An example of such messages is given below:

```
WARN** now 2050218 ps [566] timing violation in
x.y.sky130_fd_sc_hd__dfxtp_1_0_ (diff. 11 ps)

setup(of setuphold)((posedge D):2050207 ps, (posedge CLK):2050218 ps, 76 ps);
```

Reporting violations during simulation that are not identified by static timing
analysis, means you did not constraint the design probably; for example, you
specified a false path which is not. After identifying and analyzing the
violations, you need to re-run your ASIC flow to address the reported
violations.

```{warning}
The Verilog model files for sky130 libraries are known to contain some issues.
