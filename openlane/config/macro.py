class Macro:
    """
    A data structure for storing definitions of Macros.

    As it is typically stored in a dictionary in its superclass, the module name
    is not stored in any of these fields.

    You will note most fields correspond to a :class:`openlane.state.DesignFormat`
    entry IDs. This is not coincidental.

    :param gds: A list of GDSII files representing the design. At least one is required.
    :param lef: A list of LEF files representing the design. At least one is required.
    :param instances: A dictionary of :class:`Instance` objects representing the
        instances of said macro.

        The keys for the dictionaries are the names of the instances.
    :param nl: A list of netlists constituting the design.

        The netlists must be valid Verilog netlists readable by tools such as
        OpenSTA.

        Can be empty, however SPEF-based hierarchical static timing analysis
        will be unavailable.
    :param spef: A dictionary of parasitics annotations for the various netlists of the
        Macro.

        The keys are wildcards for timing corners supported by a certain SPEF file.

        Can be empty, however SPEF-based hierarchical static timing analysis
        will be unavailable.
    :param lib: A dictionary of timing library files.

        The keys are wildcards for timing corners supported by a certain LIB file.

        If both SPEF and LIB views are empty, the design may be black-boxed
        during STA.
    :param spice: A list of SPICE netlists constituting the design. May be
        useful in some flows.
    :param sdf: A dictionary of standard delay format files. May be useful in some flows.

        The keys are wildcards for timing corners supported by a certain SPEF file.
    :param json_h: A JSON file as generated by Yosys. Helpful in some flows.
