OpenLane is a RTL to GDSII infrastructure library based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, CVC, KLayout and a number of custom scripts for design exploration and optimization. A reference flow performs all ASIC implementation steps from RTL all the way down to GDSII.

You can find the documentation [here](https://openlane2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/) to get started.

```python
from openlane.flows import Flow

Classic = Flow.factory.get("Classic")

flow = Classic(
    {
        "PDK": "sky130A",
        "DESIGN_NAME": "spm",
        "VERILOG_FILES": ["./src/spm.v"],
        "CLOCK_PORT": "clk",
        "CLOCK_PERIOD": 10,
    },
    design_dir=".",
)

flow.start()
```


## Installation
You'll need the following:
* Python **3.8** or higher with PIP, Venv and Tkinter

### Nix (Recommended)
Works for macOS and Linux (x86-64). Recommended, as it is more integrated with your filesystem and overall has less upload and download deltas.

See [Nix-based installation](https://openlane2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/nix_installation/index.html) in the docs.

### Docker
Works for Windows, macOS and Linux (x86-64, aarch64 with emulation).

See [Docker-based installation](https://openlane2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/docker_installation/index.html) in the docs.

Do note you'll need to add `--dockerized` right after `openlane` in most CLI invocations.

### Python-only Installation (Advanced)
You'll need to bring your own compiled utilities, but otherwise, simply install OpenLane as follows:

```sh
python3 -m pip install --upgrade openlane
```

## Usage
In the root folder of the repository, you may invoke:

```sh
python3 -m openlane --pdk-root <path/to/pdk> </path/to/config.json>
```

To start with, you can try:

```sh
python3 -m openlane --pdk-root $HOME/.volare ./designs/spm/config.json
```
